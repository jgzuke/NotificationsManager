# NotificationsManager
User creates sets of rules that change your vibration/ring settings for certain contacts.
These sets become active during certain times. Eg. Work setting active 9-5 Mon-Fri.

Each rule has a contact, a type of message (text/call), an action (silent/vibrate/ring), and the rule set it belongs to.
Each time interval has a start and end time, and a rule set to activate
